; Core arithmetic operators.

import integer i

; OPERATOR NAMES
;
; Most operators use the same names as their C counterparts. Operators without
; a type prefix implicitly apply to signed integers; types are notated as a
; mnemonic before the operator, eg, ".+" for floating-point addition or "u+"
; for unsigned (wrapping) addition.
;
; The modulus operator is %, since it's what most people want (see $i.mod vs
; $i.rem). The truncating remainder is %%.
;
; All the bitwise operators have a ^ appended since they are not used
; frequently enough to justify such short names. >>^ is logical shift, as it is
; what's most commonly used in practise, and >>-^ is arithmetic shift.
;
; OPERATOR PRECEDENCE
;
; Generally, we want to maintain a relatively C-like operator precedence,
; except for obvious mistakes like the bit-twiddling operators. Also, unary
; operators cannot have different precedence from their binary counterparts.
;
; If we exactly cloned C, the table would be
;
;    ! ~^               Unary RTL
;    * / % %%           LTR
;    + -                LTR
;    <<^ >>^ >>-^       LTR
;    < <= > >=          LTR
;    == !=              LTR
;    &^                 LTR
;    ^^                 LTR
;    |^                 LTR
;    &&                 LTR
;    ||                 LTR
;    =                  RTL
;
; Basically, the changes here are:
;
; - All the relational operators should be at the same level. Nobody ever
;   writes ( a < b == c < d ) in C and expects it to be understood by a human.
;
; - All the binary bit-twiddling operators are at the same level, immediately
;   above the relational operators.
;
; We also need to place the string-concatenation operators. It seems most
; natural for these to be directly above the relational operators, since
; embedding the results of comparisons in strings is not very common but
; embedding the results of arithmetic is; conversely, arithmetic on
; concatenated strings is unlikely to be common, but comparisons (b== in
; particular) could be.
;
; This gives us
