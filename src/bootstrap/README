This directory provides the "bootstrap toolchain", which is used for
building the avast library.

Ordinarily, these tools are built automatically before avast is needed.
However, when cross-compiling, versions of these tools compiled for the
host must be used instead.

These tools are not intended to be user-friendly. In particular, since
they are used for building the core library, it will not be available
when this toolchain is used.
