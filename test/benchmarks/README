This directory contains benchmarks comparing Avalanche's performance of
particular operations to the nearest equivalent in other languages/runtimes.

The main build system only builds the Avalanche-based benchmarks; those for
other systems must be built by hand. Instructions are included at the top of
each ifle.

C++ STL benchmarks are not included due to varying implementations and the
ability for the compiler to optimise for the benchmark itself.

Interpreted languages obviously incur a penalty for their interpretation. Java
pays a heavy price for start-up.
