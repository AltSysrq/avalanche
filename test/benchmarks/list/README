List Append/Read Benchmark

The executable is run with two command-line arguments, both of which are
integers. The first is the list size; the second is 0 or 1 to indicate whether
the second stage of the benchmark is to be run.

The test operates as follows:

1. Create an empty list. Make no assumptions about the size of list that would
   be built (eg, that would cause certain libraries to degenerate into static
   arrays).

2. Add every 64-bit integer from 0 (inclusive) to the first command-line
   argument (exclusive) to the list, one at a time.

3. If the second command-line argument was 0, exit.

4. Otherwise, iterate through the list and sum the values it contains, without
   using knowledge of the command-line arguments.
