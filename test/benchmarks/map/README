Map Append/Read Benchmark

The executable is run with two command-line arguments, both of which are
integers. The first is the list size; the second is 0 or 1 to indicate whether
the second stage of the benchmark is to be run.

The test operates as follows:

1. Create an empty map. Make no assumptions about the size of map that would
   be built or the nature of its contents (except for the type).

2. Map every 64-bit integer from 0 (inclusive) to the first command-line
   argument (exclusive) to its successor (ie, 0->1, 1->2, ...).

3. If the second command-line argument was 0, exit.

4. Otherwise, iterate through the integers from 0 to n and sum the keys mapped
   to each of them.
