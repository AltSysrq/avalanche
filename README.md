Avalanche
=========

Introduction
------------

Avalanche is a minimalist, compiled language strongly inspired by Tcl. It is
not intended to be terribly fast, nor to be memory-safe. Its main strengths are
its compact and flexible syntax, ease of string handling, and trivial binding
to C functions.

See [the spec](SPEC.md) for a description of how the language works.

Examples
--------

### Hello World

```
  puts "hello world"
```
